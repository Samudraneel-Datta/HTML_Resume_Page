This is a basic resume page of mine using html only

To set this repo locally follow the steps:
1. clone the project using either https or ssh(you must have a ssh key set up) using the command git clone https://github.com/Samudraneel-Datta/HTML_Resume_Page.git
2. Install the live server on your vscode or something using which you run html files
3. Simply click on "Go Live" (if using live serer) or run the file in your browser
4. My highly classified resume will open

THANK YOU :)
